## Code guide
This guide is to explain the different code files related to this manuscript.

### abundance_diversity_plots.R
Code to make plots related to abundance, diversity, and presence of individual species within each cluster.

### CorrelationMatrix.R
Creates a correlation matrix for the lidar variables used in the model selection (FinalModelSelection.R)

### FinalModelSelection.R
Code for generalized models developed for analysis

### kmeans.R
K-means cluster analysis and randomized site selection for the lidar data over the entirety of Ordway-Swisher.

### rarefaction.R
Creates species richness curves to measure sampling effort in each cluster.

### wingloading_aspect.R
Creates a graph of wing loading vs aspect ratio based on data from Farney and Flaherty, 1969.
